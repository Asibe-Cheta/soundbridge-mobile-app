# üîç Mobile App Timeout Debug Analysis

## üö® CURRENT ISSUE:
Mobile app shows "Server Issue - payment server not responding" but Stripe is actually working (user received SMS verification code).

## üìä CONSOLE LOG ANALYSIS:

### ‚úÖ WHAT WE SEE:
- User authentication: SUCCESS
- API endpoint called: `https://soundbridge.live/api/stripe/create-checkout-session`
- Request headers: Correct (Bearer token, content-type, etc.)
- Request body: `{amount: 999, currency: 'usd', product_name: 'Pro Plan (monthly)', ...}`

### ‚ùå WHAT'S MISSING:
- **NO DEBUG LOGS** from our recent deployment
- **NO "üö® STRIPE CHECKOUT DEBUG:" logs**
- **NO price ID, plan, billing cycle info**

## üéØ POSSIBLE CAUSES:

### 1. **Vercel Function Timeout**
- **Issue:** Function times out before completing
- **Evidence:** Mobile app shows timeout error but Stripe processes request
- **Solution:** Increase timeout or optimize function

### 2. **Cache/Deployment Issue**
- **Issue:** Old code still running, new debug logs not deployed
- **Evidence:** Missing debug logs we just added
- **Solution:** Force cache clear, verify deployment

### 3. **Request/Response Size Issue**
- **Issue:** Response too large or malformed
- **Evidence:** Request succeeds but response fails
- **Solution:** Check response format

### 4. **CORS/Header Issue**
- **Issue:** Response blocked by mobile app
- **Evidence:** API works but mobile app can't process response
- **Solution:** Check response headers

## üöÄ IMMEDIATE ACTIONS:

### For Backend Team:
1. **Verify deployment** - Check if debug logs are actually deployed
2. **Check Vercel logs** - Look for function timeouts or errors
3. **Test API directly** - Use Postman/curl to test endpoint
4. **Add response logging** - Log the actual response being sent

### For Mobile Team:
1. **Check timeout settings** - Increase API timeout duration
2. **Check response handling** - Verify JSON parsing
3. **Check error handling** - Look for specific error details
4. **Test with localhost** - Compare localhost vs production behavior

## üîß QUICK TESTS:

### Test 1: Direct API Call
```bash
curl -X POST https://soundbridge.live/api/stripe/create-checkout-session \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "x-supabase-token: YOUR_TOKEN" \
  -d '{"plan": "pro", "billingCycle": "monthly"}'
```

### Test 2: Check Vercel Logs
- Go to Vercel dashboard
- Check function logs for timeouts/errors
- Look for our debug statements

### Test 3: Compare with Working Localhost
- What's different between localhost and production?
- Are environment variables the same?
- Are Stripe keys configured correctly?

## üìû QUESTIONS FOR MOBILE TEAM:

1. **Timeout Duration:** How long does mobile app wait for API response?
2. **Error Details:** Any more specific error info in mobile logs?
3. **Localhost Config:** What's different in localhost setup?
4. **Response Handling:** How does app process the checkout URL response?
5. **SMS Code:** Did you complete the Stripe checkout flow after receiving SMS?

## üéØ HYPOTHESIS:
The API is working (Stripe processes the request) but either:
- **Takes too long** to respond (mobile app times out)
- **Response format** is wrong (mobile app can't parse it)
- **New code** isn't deployed yet (missing debug logs)
