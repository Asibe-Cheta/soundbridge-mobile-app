## 📈 **ANALYTICS & MONITORING** - READY

### **Real-Time Ad Performance Tracking:**
```sql
-- Daily ad performance dashboard
SELECT 
  ad_type,
  placement,
  COUNT(*) as impressions,
  SUM(CASE WHEN clicked THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) as clicks,
  ROUND((SUM(CASE WHEN clicked THEN 1 ELSE 0 END)::DECIMAL / COUNT(*)) * 100, 2) as ctr_percentage
FROM ad_impressions
WHERE DATE(impression_time) = CURRENT_DATE
GROUP BY ad_type, placement;
```

### **User Tier Analytics:**
```sql
-- User engagement by subscription tier
SELECT 
  COALESCE(us.tier, 'free') as user_tier,
  COUNT(DISTINCT ai.user_id) as unique_users,
  COUNT(ai.id) as total_impressions,
  AVG(CASE WHEN ai.clicked THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) as avg_click_rate
FROM ad_impressions ai
LEFT JOIN user_subscriptions us ON us.user_id = ai.user_id AND us.status = 'active'
WHERE DATE(ai.impression_time) = CURRENT_DATE
GROUP BY us.tier
ORDER BY total_impressions DESC;
```

### **Conversion Tracking:**
```sql
-- Track ad-to-subscription conversions
SELECT COUNT(*) as ad_to_pro_conversions
FROM ad_impressions ai
INNER JOIN user_subscriptions us ON us.user_id = ai.user_id
WHERE us.tier IN ('pro', 'enterprise')
AND us.created_at > ai.impression_time
AND ai.impression_time >= NOW() - INTERVAL '30 days';
```

## 🎨 **CUSTOMIZATION OPTIONS** - AVAILABLE
