# Mobile Team: Creator Collaboration Calendar System Request

**Date**: December 16, 2024  
**From**: Mobile Development Team  
**To**: Web App Development Team  
**Priority**: High  

---

## **Request Summary**

The mobile team is implementing a **Creator Collaboration Calendar & Request System** that allows creators to:
1. Set their availability for collaboration requests
2. Send/receive collaboration requests with mandatory notes
3. Accept/reject requests with response messages
4. Display booking status on creator profiles

We understand this feature has been addressed on the web app side and need the existing implementation details to ensure consistency across platforms.

## **Specific Information Needed**

### **1. Database Schema**
Please provide the complete database schema for:

#### **A. Creator Availability System**
- Table name(s) for storing creator availability slots
- Fields: creator_id, date/time slots, booking status, etc.
- Indexes and constraints
- Relationship to profiles table

#### **B. Collaboration Requests System**
- Table name(s) for collaboration requests
- Fields: sender_id, receiver_id, requested_date/time, messages, status, etc.
- Status enum values (pending, accepted, rejected, etc.)
- Timestamps and audit fields

#### **C. Related Tables**
- Any junction tables or supporting schemas
- Notification/messaging integration
- Calendar event integration (if applicable)

### **2. API Endpoints**
Please provide documentation for existing endpoints:

#### **A. Availability Management**
```
GET /api/creators/{id}/availability - Get creator's availability
POST /api/creators/{id}/availability - Set availability slots
PUT /api/creators/{id}/availability/{slot_id} - Update availability
DELETE /api/creators/{id}/availability/{slot_id} - Remove availability
```

#### **B. Collaboration Requests**
```
GET /api/collaboration-requests - Get user's requests (sent/received)
POST /api/collaboration-requests - Send new collaboration request
PUT /api/collaboration-requests/{id}/respond - Accept/reject request
GET /api/creators/{id}/booking-status - Check if creator is available
```

#### **C. Request/Response Formats**
- Complete JSON schemas for all endpoints
- Error response formats
- Validation rules and constraints

### **3. Business Logic**
Please clarify the following business rules:

#### **A. Availability System**
- How are time slots defined? (hourly, custom ranges, etc.)
- Can creators set recurring availability?
- How far in advance can availability be set?
- What happens to existing requests when availability changes?

#### **B. Booking Logic**
- When is a creator considered "fully booked"?
- Can multiple requests be made for the same time slot?
- Is there a first-come-first-served system?
- How are time zone differences handled?

#### **C. Request Workflow**
- What are all possible request statuses?
- Can requests be modified after sending?
- Is there an expiration system for pending requests?
- Are there any rate limits on sending requests?

### **4. UI/UX Specifications**
If available, please share:

#### **A. Web App Implementation**
- Screenshots of the availability calendar interface
- Collaboration request form design
- Profile integration (booking status display)
- Notification/messaging UI

#### **B. User Flows**
- Step-by-step creator availability setup process
- Collaboration request sending/receiving flow
- Request response and follow-up process

### **5. Integration Points**

#### **A. Notification System**
- How are collaboration requests delivered to users?
- Real-time notifications vs email/push?
- Integration with existing messaging system?

#### **B. Calendar Integration**
- Does this integrate with external calendars (Google, Outlook)?
- Calendar event creation for accepted collaborations?
- Sync with other platform scheduling features?

#### **C. Creator Profile Integration**
- How is booking status displayed on profiles?
- Button states (active/inactive) logic
- Integration with creator verification/badges?

## **Mobile-Specific Considerations**

### **1. Offline Functionality**
- Can availability be set/viewed offline?
- How should pending requests be handled offline?
- Sync strategy when coming back online?

### **2. Push Notifications**
- What events trigger push notifications?
- Notification payload structure needed?
- Deep linking requirements for notifications?

### **3. Performance Requirements**
- Expected request volume per creator?
- Calendar data caching strategy?
- Pagination for request history?
