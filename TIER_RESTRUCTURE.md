# SoundBridge Pricing Tiers - Year 1 Structure

**Last Updated:** November 29, 2025  
**Status:** Approved for Implementation  
**Target Launch:** Q1 2026

---

## Overview

SoundBridge operates on a freemium model with two tiers designed to convert users at critical professional workflow moments. The structure balances accessibility (robust free tier) with conversion incentives (removing pain points at upgrade).

**No Free Trial Strategy:** SoundBridge does NOT offer a 7-day free trial. Instead, the generous Free tier acts as an unlimited trial period, and Pro upgrades come with a **7-day money-back guarantee**. This prevents exploitation while still offering risk-free evaluation.

### Pricing Summary

| Tier | Monthly | Annual | Savings |
|------|---------|--------|---------|
| **Free** | £0 | £0 | - |
| **Pro** | £9.99/mo | £99/yr | £20.88 (17% discount) |

**Annual Conversion Message:** "Save £20 - that's 2 months free!"

**Money-Back Guarantee:** All Pro upgrades include a 7-day money-back guarantee. If you're not satisfied within 7 days of payment, request a full refund - no questions asked.

## Money-Back Guarantee & Refund Policy

### Why No Free Trial?

**SoundBridge does NOT offer a traditional 7-day free trial.** Instead, we use a superior model:

1. **Free Tier = Unlimited Trial**
   - No credit card required
   - No time limits
   - Full access to test core features (3 uploads, searches, messaging)
   - Users can evaluate platform value before committing

2. **Pro Upgrade = 7-Day Money-Back Guarantee**
   - Pay upfront (£9.99 monthly or £99 annually)
   - If not satisfied within 7 days → full refund, no questions asked
   - Account reverts to Free tier
   - Your work is protected (see below)

### Why This Approach?

**Prevents Exploitation:**
- ✅ Credit card requirement creates commitment friction
- ✅ Payment collection discourages "serial trial users"
- ✅ Refund process requires deliberate action (stops casual exploitation)
- ✅ Tracks refund patterns to identify abuse

**Better Economics:**
- ✅ Collect revenue upfront (vs. £0 during trial period)
- ✅ Refund rate typically 3-5% (95%+ users keep subscription)
- ✅ Higher conversion than traditional trials (payment = psychological commitment)

**Simpler User Experience:**
- ✅ No confusing "trial limits vs. full Pro limits"
- ✅ Clear path: Free → Upgrade → Money-back guarantee
- ✅ Aligns with industry best practices (Netflix, Spotify, Adobe all moved away from free trials)

### Refund Process

**User requests refund within 7 days of payment:**

**Step 1: Cancellation Confirmation**
```
"Are you sure you want to cancel?

You're within your 7-day money-back guarantee period.

[Keep Pro Subscription] [Process Refund & Cancel]"
```

**Step 2: Track Selection (if user has >3 uploads)**
```
"We're sorry to see you go!

Your refund of £9.99 will be processed within 3-5 business days.
Your account will revert to Free tier, which includes 3 track uploads.

You currently have 8 tracks uploaded. Which 3 would you like to keep public?

[Select 3 tracks to keep]

Note: Your other tracks will be private (not deleted). You can restore them
anytime by upgrading to Pro again."
```

**Step 3: Confirmation & Processing**
- Stripe refund processed (3-5 business days)
- User tier → 'free'
- Selected 3 tracks remain public
- Remaining tracks → `visibility: 'private'`
- Confirmation email sent
- Optional exit survey (to improve product)

### What Happens to Uploaded Tracks?

**Critical: Tracks are NEVER deleted during refund/downgrade process**

**Scenario 1: User Upgrades to Pro, Uploads 10 Tracks, Requests Refund**
- Full refund processed ✅
- User selects 3 tracks to keep public
- Remaining 7 tracks → private (hidden from public, accessible in user's dashboard)
- If user re-upgrades later → all 10 tracks automatically public again

**Scenario 2: Free User Has 3 Tracks, Upgrades to Pro, Adds 7 More, Then Downgrades**
- User selects which 3 tracks stay public (can be any of the 10)
- Other 7 → private
- No data loss, just visibility change

**Track Visibility States:**
- `public` - Visible to everyone, appears in search/profile
- `private` - Only visible to user, hidden from public
- `unlisted` - Accessible via direct link only (future feature)

### Preventing Serial Refund Abuse

**Refund Tracking System:**
- Track refund history by:
  - Email address
  - Payment method (last 4 digits)
  - IP address (for pattern detection)
  - Device fingerprint

**Abuse Prevention Rules:**

**1st Refund:**
- ✅ Processed automatically, no questions asked
- ✅ User maintains good standing

**2nd Refund (same user):**
- ⚠️ Manual review triggered
- ⚠️ Email: "We notice this is your second refund. Is there something we can help with?"
- ✅ Refund still processed, but flagged

**3rd+ Refund (same user):**
- ❌ No more money-back guarantee
- Email: "We notice you've requested multiple refunds. Unfortunately, we can no longer offer the money-back guarantee on future subscriptions. However, you can continue using our Free tier."
- User can still upgrade to Pro, but no refund option

**Multiple Account Detection:**
- If same payment method used across multiple accounts → flag as suspicious
- If same IP address with multiple refunds → flag for review
- Stripe's built-in fraud detection catches most patterns

### Edge Cases

**Edge Case 1: Annual Subscriber Requests Refund After 5 Days**
- Same 7-day money-back guarantee applies
- Full £99 refund processed
- Account reverts to Free tier
- Track selection process same as monthly

**Edge Case 2: User Requests Refund After 8 Days**
- Outside 7-day window
- No refund, but can cancel subscription
- Pro benefits continue until end of billing period
- Then account downgrades to Free tier

**Edge Case 3: Payment Fails After Initial Success**
- Grace period: 7 days to update payment method
- Email notifications: Days 1, 3, 5, 7
- After 7 days → subscription cancelled, account → Free tier
- Track selection process initiated automatically

**Edge Case 4: User Disputes Charge with Bank (Chargeback)**
- Stripe handles dispute process
- Account immediately suspended pending resolution
- If chargeback successful → account → Free tier (no track selection, system auto-selects first 3)
- If chargeback fails → account restored
- User flagged for future fraud prevention

### Messaging to Users

**Why Don't You Have a Free Trial?**

> **"Our Free tier IS your trial!"**
> 
> You can test SoundBridge completely free with 3 uploads, professional searches, and direct messaging - no credit card required, no time limits.
> 
> When you're ready for unlimited access, upgrade to Pro risk-free with our 7-day money-back guarantee. If it's not right for you, we'll refund you in full - no questions asked.

## Removed Features (Not Viable for Year 1)

The following features were considered but removed from Year 1 scope:

- ❌ **AI Copyright Detection** - Too expensive, liability-heavy, not core value
- ❌ **AI Mastering Tools** - Requires expensive AI infrastructure
- ❌ **White-label Options** - Too complex for initial launch
- ❌ **API Access** - Not needed until developer ecosystem exists
- ❌ **Custom Integrations** - Support burden too high
- ❌ **Advanced Analytics** - Need more data first
- ❌ **Team/Agency Accounts** - Add in Year 2
- ❌ **Multi-user Permissions** - Add in Year 2

---

## Copyright Handling (All Tiers)

Instead of AI detection, SoundBridge uses:

- **User Certification:** At upload, users certify they own rights or have permission
- **DMCA Takedown Process:** Standard process for copyright claims
- **Community Reporting:** Users can report copyright violations
- **Terms of Service Enforcement:** Violations result in content removal and potential account suspension
- **Three-Strike Policy:** Repeated violations lead to permanent ban
- **Appeal Process:** Users can appeal copyright strikes with proof of ownership

**Philosophy:** Users manage their own copyright (like SoundCloud), platform responds to valid claims

---

## Technical Feasibility

### Storage Costs (Year 1 - 5,000 users)

**Conservative Estimate:**
- 4,000 Free users × 150MB = 600GB
- 1,000 Pro users × 500MB = 500GB
- **Total Storage: 1.1TB**

**Supabase Pricing:**
- First 100GB: Free tier
- Additional 1TB: ~£0.021/GB/month = £21/month
- **Annual Storage Cost: ~£252**

**With 10,000 users by end of Year 1:**
- Estimated storage: ~2TB
- **Annual cost: ~£500**

✅ **Completely manageable**

### Bandwidth Costs (Streaming)

**Assumptions:**
- Average track: 5MB (compressed for streaming)
- Each track averages 100 plays/month
- 5,000 users × average 3 tracks × 5MB × 100 plays = 7.5TB/month

**Estimated Cost:** £50-100/month = **£600-1,200/year**

**Optimization Strategies:**
- Cloudflare CDN for caching popular tracks
- Progressive loading/streaming
- Quality-based streaming (adjust for connection speed)

✅ **Manageable with CDN optimization**

### Why 10 Tracks for Pro Is Feasible

**Math Check:**
- 1,000 Pro users × 10 tracks = 10,000 Pro tracks
- 4,000 Free users × 3 tracks = 12,000 Free tracks
- **Total: 22,000 tracks**

**With compression:**
- Average compressed track: ~8MB (high-quality streaming)
- 22,000 × 8MB = **176GB**

✅ **Very manageable** - Could even support 15-20 tracks per Pro user if needed

## Conversion Psychology

### Free-to-Pro Conversion Path

**Scenario 1: Communication Limit**
1. User signs up, uploads 3 tracks ✅
2. Searches for collaborators (uses 2 of 5 searches) ✅
3. Finds perfect producer, sends message (1 of 3) ✅
4. Producer replies, conversation starts ✅
5. Needs to send follow-up question... **OUT OF MESSAGES** ❌
6. Sees: "Upgrade to Pro for unlimited messaging" 💰
7. **CONVERTS**

**Scenario 2: Discovery Limitation**
1. User getting good traction on platform ✅
2. Another producer wants to message them ✅
3. User wants to search producer's profile/past work... **OUT OF SEARCHES** ❌
4. Sees: "Upgrade to Pro for unlimited searches" 💰
5. **CONVERTS**

**Scenario 3: Professional Opportunity**
1. User discovered by established artist ✅
2. Artist wants to book them for session work (£300 gig) ✅
3. User can't initiate booking without Pro ❌
4. Sees: "Upgrade to Pro to accept paid bookings with payment protection" 💰
5. **CONVERTS** (£9.99 to unlock £300 opportunity = no-brainer)

**Scenario 4: Track Limit**
1. User uploaded 3 tracks, getting good engagement ✅
2. Just finished new single, wants to upload ❌
3. Must delete old track or upgrade
4. Sees: "Keep all your work online - upgrade to Pro for 10 track uploads" 💰
5. **CONVERTS**

### Why £9.99/Month Works

**Psychological Pricing:**
- Below £10 = impulse purchase threshold (doesn't require "considered expense" justification)
- Perceived as "single digit" not "double digit"
- Cheaper than Spotify Premium (£10.99) = easy mental anchor
- Annual (£99) stays below £100 psychological barrier

**Competitive Positioning:**
- LinkedIn Premium: £24.99/month (SoundBridge is 60% cheaper)
- SoundBetter Pro: $14.99/month ≈ £12 (SoundBridge is comparable/cheaper)
- Patreon creator fees: 5-12% + subscription (SoundBridge offers better value)

**Value Perception:**
- Professional tool, not consumer entertainment
- Unlocks income opportunities (bookings worth £100-1,000+)
- ROI: One booking pays for 10+ months of subscription

---

## Launch Strategy

### Early Adopter Promotion (First 3 Months)

**"Founding Member" Pricing:**
- Pro Annual: ~~£99~~ **£79/year** (20% discount)
- Pro Monthly: £9.99/month (no discount - encourage annual)
- **Lifetime rate lock:** "Your rate never increases"
- Badge: "Founding Member" on profile (social proof/status)

**Benefits:**
- ✅ Generates upfront cash flow (annual payments)
- ✅ Creates urgency ("limited time offer")
- ✅ Builds loyal early user base
- ✅ Locked-in users become advocates
- ✅ Can raise prices for new users later (grandfathered pricing creates FOMO)

**Marketing Message:**
> "Join SoundBridge as a Founding Member and lock in lifetime access to Pro for just £79/year - that's 20% off forever. Limited to first 500 members."

### Post-Launch (Month 4+)

- Return to standard £99/year pricing
- Founding Members keep £79 forever (creates urgency for new users)
- Case studies from Founding Members ("I saved £20/year for life!")

---

## Expected Conversion Rates

### Industry Benchmarks (Freemium SaaS)

- LinkedIn: ~1% free → Premium conversion
- Spotify: ~2.5% free → Premium conversion
- Professional tools: 5-15% conversion (higher for B2B/professional use cases)

### SoundBridge Projections

**Year 1 (Conservative):**
- Total users: 5,000
- Conversion rate: 10%
- Pro subscribers: 500
- Mix: 70% annual (£99) + 30% monthly (£9.99)
  - 350 annual × £99 = £34,650
  - 150 monthly × £9.99 × 12 = £17,982
- **Subscription Revenue: £52,632**

**Year 1 (Optimistic with Founding Member pricing):**
- 500 Pro subscribers at £79 (early adopter rate)
- **Subscription Revenue: £39,500**
- (Lower revenue Year 1, but higher lifetime value due to lock-in)

**Year 2:**
- Total users: 25,000
- Conversion rate: 10%
- Pro subscribers: 2,500
- **Subscription Revenue: £247,500**

**Year 3:**
- Total users: 75,000
- Conversion rate: 10%
- Pro subscribers: 7,500
- **Subscription Revenue: £742,500**

🔒 Secure payment processing via Stripe

### FAQ Section

**Do you offer a free trial?**

We don't offer a traditional free trial because our Free tier IS your trial! You get unlimited time to test SoundBridge with 3 uploads, professional searches, and messaging - no credit card required.

When you're ready to upgrade to Pro, you're protected by our 7-day money-back guarantee. If Pro isn't right for you, request a refund within 7 days for a full refund, no questions asked.

**Can I change my plan later?**

Yes! You can upgrade from Free to Pro anytime. If you start with monthly, you can switch to annual to save money. You can also cancel anytime - if you're within the first 7 days, you'll get a full refund.

**What happens when I hit my limits on Free?**

You'll see a notification letting you know you've reached your limit (searches or messages). You can wait until next month when limits reset, or upgrade to Pro anytime for unlimited access.

**Can I cancel anytime?**

Absolutely. You can cancel your Pro subscription anytime:
- **Within 7 days of payment:** Full refund, account reverts to Free tier
- **After 7 days:** No refund, but Pro benefits continue until end of billing period, then account reverts to Free tier

**What payment methods do you accept?**

We accept all major credit and debit cards (Visa, Mastercard, American Express) via Stripe. Your payment information is secure, encrypted, and never stored on our servers.

**How does the 7-day money-back guarantee work?**

If you upgrade to Pro and decide it's not for you within 7 days of payment, simply request a refund from your billing settings. You'll receive a full refund within 3-5 business days, no questions asked. Your account will revert to the Free tier.

**What happens to my content if I cancel or request a refund?**

Your content is never deleted. If you have more than 3 tracks when you downgrade to Free, you'll choose which 3 to keep public. The rest become private (only visible to you). If you upgrade to Pro again later, all your tracks automatically become public again.

**What if I uploaded 10 tracks on Pro and then cancel?**

When you cancel or request a refund, you'll select which 3 tracks to keep public (Free tier limit). Your other 7 tracks will be private - still accessible to you in your dashboard, but hidden from public view. If you re-upgrade to Pro, they'll automatically become public again. Your music is never deleted.

**Can I get a refund after 7 days?**

The money-back guarantee only applies within 7 days of payment. After 7 days, you can cancel your subscription, but won't receive a refund. Your Pro benefits will continue until the end of your current billing period.

**How do I request a refund?**

Go to Account Settings → Billing → Cancel Subscription. If you're within your 7-day window, you'll see the option to request a full refund. Click it, follow the prompts, and your refund will be processed automatically.

## Notes for Development Team

### Technical Priorities

1. **Security:** All payment processing via Stripe (PCI compliant)
2. **Scalability:** Database indexes on subscription lookups
3. **Performance:** Cache tier permissions, don't query on every request
4. **Reliability:** Webhook retry logic for failed subscription events
5. **User Experience:** Upgrade prompts at friction points, not annoying

### Edge Cases to Handle

- User upgrades mid-billing cycle → Pro-rate refund?
- User downgrades with >3 tracks → Soft delete excess tracks
- Payment fails → Grace period (7 days) before downgrade
- User disputes charge → Stripe dispute handling
- Accidental cancellation → Reactivation grace period
- Annual subscriber wants to switch to monthly → Allow with adjustment

### Database Considerations

**Track Visibility Management:**
```sql
-- Add to tracks table
ALTER TABLE tracks ADD COLUMN visibility VARCHAR(10) DEFAULT 'public';
-- Values: 'public', 'private', 'unlisted'

ALTER TABLE tracks ADD COLUMN uploaded_during_tier VARCHAR(10);
-- Values: 'free', 'pro'

ALTER TABLE tracks ADD COLUMN created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP;
ALTER TABLE tracks ADD COLUMN updated_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP ON UPDATE CURRENT_TIMESTAMP;
```

**Refund Tracking:**
```sql
-- Create refunds table
CREATE TABLE refunds (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT uuid_generate_v4(),
  user_id UUID REFERENCES users(id),
  subscription_id VARCHAR(255),
  stripe_refund_id VARCHAR(255),
  amount_refunded DECIMAL(10,2),
  refund_reason TEXT,
  refund_date TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
  refund_count INT, -- How many refunds this user has had
  ip_address VARCHAR(45),
  payment_method_last4 VARCHAR(4),
  flagged BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE,
  notes TEXT
);

-- Index for abuse detection
CREATE INDEX idx_refunds_user ON refunds(user_id);
CREATE INDEX idx_refunds_payment ON refunds(payment_method_last4);
CREATE INDEX idx_refunds_flagged ON refunds(flagged);
```

**Track Selection During Downgrade:**
```sql
-- Create downgrade_track_selections table
CREATE TABLE downgrade_track_selections (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT uuid_generate_v4(),
  user_id UUID REFERENCES users(id),
  downgrade_date TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
  from_tier VARCHAR(10), -- 'pro'
  to_tier VARCHAR(10), -- 'free'
  selected_track_ids UUID[], -- Array of track IDs user chose to keep public
  auto_selected BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE, -- If system auto-selected (e.g., chargeback)
  reason VARCHAR(50) -- 'refund', 'cancellation', 'payment_failure', 'chargeback'
);
```

**Logic for Track Visibility:**
- When user downgrades: Tracks beyond Free tier limit → `visibility = 'private'`
- When user re-upgrades: Previously private tracks → `visibility = 'public'`
- Tracks are NEVER deleted (unless user explicitly deletes)
- Archive old usage tracking data (searches/messages) after 12 months
- Index subscription dates for renewal queries
- Soft delete tracks (don't hard delete when downgrading)
- Track subscription history for analytics

## Financial Impact Analysis: Money-Back Guarantee vs. Free Trial

### Revenue Comparison Model

**Scenario: 5,000 Users, 10% Show Intent to Use Pro Features**

#### Traditional 7-Day Free Trial Model:
- 500 users start free trial (no payment)
- Trial conversion rate: 40-50% (industry standard)
- Actual paying users after trial: 200-250
- Revenue (assuming 225 convert): 225 × £9.99 = £2,247.75/month
- **Annual Revenue: £26,973**

**Problems with Free Trial:**
- ❌ No revenue during trial period
- ❌ Users procrastinate ("I'll try it later")
- ❌ Can exploit system (upload 10 tracks, cancel before payment)
- ❌ 50-60% of trials never convert
- ❌ Support costs for users who never pay
- ❌ 7-day delay before revenue recognition

#### SoundBridge Money-Back Guarantee Model:
- 500 users upgrade directly (pay upfront)
- Refund rate: 3-5% (industry standard for money-back guarantees)
- Actual paying users: 475-485 (assuming 5% refund rate = 475)
- Revenue: 475 × £9.99 = £4,745.25/month
- **Annual Revenue: £56,943**

**Benefits of Money-Back Guarantee:**
- ✅ **111% more revenue** than free trial model
- ✅ Immediate cash flow (payment on day 1, not day 8)
- ✅ Payment commitment = higher quality users
- ✅ Lower support burden (paying users more serious)
- ✅ Prevents exploitation (refund process creates friction)
- ✅ Better user selection (casual browsers filtered out)

---

### Why Money-Back Guarantees Convert Better

**Psychological Factors:**

**1. Loss Aversion**
- Once money leaves account, users reluctant to "lose" access
- Free trial mindset: "I haven't committed anything yet"
- Paid with guarantee mindset: "I've invested, let me get value from this"

**2. Sunk Cost Fallacy (Works in Your Favor)**
- User paid £9.99 → psychologically wants to use it
- Requesting refund requires active effort → most don't bother if getting any value
- Free trial cancellation is passive (just don't enter payment info)

**3. Selection Bias**
- Free trials attract casual browsers and tire-kickers
- Payment requirement filters for serious, committed users
- Higher intent at signup = higher retention long-term

**4. Immediacy**
- Free trial: "I'll explore this later" → never return
- Paid: "I paid for this, let me use it NOW" → immediate engagement

**Real-World Evidence:**
- **Netflix** removed free trial (2020) → subscriber growth increased
- **Spotify** requires payment method for trials → 60%+ conversion
- **Adobe** moved to paid trials → retention up 30%
- **Amazon Prime** trial requires payment → 75%+ conversion

| Attrition | 250-275 never convert | 25 refunds requested | **-225** |
| **Active Paying Customers** | **225** | **475** | **+111%** |
| Monthly Recurring Revenue | £2,247.75 | £4,745.25 | +£2,497.50 |
| **Annual Recurring Revenue** | **£26,973** | **£56,943** | **+£29,970** |
| Refund costs | £0 | £249.75 (25 refunds) | +£249.75 |
| **Net Annual Revenue** | **£26,973** | **£56,693.25** | **+£29,720** |

**Key Insight:** Money-back guarantee generates **110% more annual revenue** with minimal refund cost (£249.75).

### Cash Flow Impact

**Free Trial Model:**
- Month 1: £0 (users in trial)
- Month 2: £2,247.75 (50% convert after trial)
- Month 3: £2,247.75
- **Q1 Total: £4,495.50**

**Money-Back Guarantee Model:**
- Month 1: £4,745.25 (immediate payment)
- Refunds: -£249.75 (5% refund over month)
- Month 2: £4,745.25
- Month 3: £4,745.25
- **Q1 Total: £13,986 (after refunds)**

**Q1 Cash Flow Advantage: £9,490.50** (211% more)

### Customer Quality Comparison

- Serious intent demonstrated upfront
- "I'm ready to use this now" mindset
- Support time generates revenue

**Lifetime Value Impact:**
- Free trial converts: 12-month retention ~60%
- Direct paid converts: 12-month retention ~80%
- Money-back guarantee users are higher quality, longer-term customers
