# 🚨 URGENT: Mobile App Supabase Integration Issues

**Date:** October 2, 2025  
**Priority:** 🚨 **CRITICAL**  
**Status:** Need Immediate Clarification  
**From:** Mobile App Development Team

## 🔥 **CRITICAL ISSUES OBSERVED**

### **Issue 1: Session/Authentication Errors**
```
Error getting initial session: TypeError: Cannot read property 'getSession' of undefined
```

### **Issue 2: Mock Data Still Showing**
- Home screen shows "Loading creators (temporary mock data until web app team provides correct integration)..."
- Hot Creators and Events sections display mock data instead of real Supabase data
- All Creators and All Events screens also show mock data

### **Issue 3: AsyncStorage Import Error (FIXED)**
- Duplicate AsyncStorage imports were causing syntax errors
- This has been resolved

## 🚨 **URGENT QUESTIONS**

### **1. Authentication Setup**
**Q:** What is the correct way to handle authentication in the mobile app for Supabase queries?
- Should we be using `supabase.auth.getSession()` or a different method?
- Do we need to authenticate users before querying public data like creators and events?
- Is there a specific authentication flow we should follow?

### **2. Database Schema Confirmation**
**Q:** Can you confirm the exact table names and column structures we should be querying?

**Expected tables:**
- `profiles` (for creators) - columns: `id`, `username`, `display_name`, `bio`, `avatar_url`, `role`, etc.
- `events` (for events) - columns: `id`, `title`, `description`, `event_date`, `location`, etc.
- `audio_tracks` (for tracks) - columns: `id`, `title`, `creator_id`, etc.

**Are these table names and structures correct?**

### **3. Row Level Security (RLS) Policies**
**Q:** What are the RLS policies for public data access?
- Can anonymous users query `profiles` where `role` = 'creator'?
- Can anonymous users query `events` table?
- Do we need any special permissions or policies?

### **4. Supabase Configuration**
**Q:** Are these the correct Supabase credentials for the mobile app?

**Current config:**
```typescript
url: 'https://aunxdbqukbxyyiusaeqi.supabase.co'
anonKey: 'eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpc3MiOiJzdXBhYmFzZSIsInJlZiI6ImF1bnhkYnF1a2J4eXlpdXNhZXFpIiwicm9sZSI6ImFub24iLCJpYXQiOjE3NTI2OTA2MTUsImV4cCI6MjA2ODI2NjYxNX0.IP-c4_S7Fkbq6F2UkgzL-TibkoBN49yQ1Cqz4CkMzB0'
```

### **5. Simple Test Query**
**Q:** Can you provide a simple, working query example that we can test?

**Example we need:**
```typescript
// Get 5 creators
const { data, error } = await supabase
  .from('profiles')
  .select('id, username, display_name, bio, avatar_url')
  .eq('role', 'creator')
  .limit(5);
```

**Should this work without authentication? If not, what's the correct approach?**

## 🎯 **WHAT WE NEED**

### **Immediate Actions Required:**
1. **✅ Confirm database schema** - table names and column names
2. **✅ Confirm RLS policies** - what can anonymous users access?
3. **✅ Provide working query examples** - simple queries that should work
4. **✅ Clarify authentication requirements** - when is auth needed vs not needed?

### **Working Code Examples Needed:**
```typescript
// 1. Get creators (working example)
const getCreators = async () => {
  // YOUR WORKING CODE HERE
};

// 2. Get events (working example)  
const getEvents = async () => {
  // YOUR WORKING CODE HERE
};

// 3. Authentication setup (if needed)
const setupAuth = async () => {
  // YOUR WORKING CODE HERE
};
```

## 📱 **CURRENT MOBILE APP STATUS**

### **✅ What's Working:**
- Supabase client setup
- Navigation between screens
- UI components and theming
- Cache implementation

### **❌ What's Broken:**
- Session/authentication errors
- Data fetching returns mock data instead of real data
- Connection to Supabase database

### **🔧 What We've Tried:**
- Updated Supabase client configuration
- Fixed import errors
- Added connection testing
- Implemented proper error handling

---

## ⏰ **TIMELINE**

**Need Response By:** Immediately (within 1-2 hours)  
**Reason:** Mobile app is currently showing mock data instead of real data from the database.

---

## 🚀 **SUCCESS CRITERIA**

When resolved, the mobile app should:
1. **✅ Display real creators** in Hot Creators section on Home screen
2. **✅ Display real events** in Upcoming Events section on Home screen  
3. **✅ Show real data** in All Creators and All Events screens
4. **✅ No authentication errors** in console
5. **✅ Proper navigation** from Home screen chevron buttons to respective screens

**Status:** ⏳ **WAITING FOR WEB APP TEAM RESPONSE**  
**Next Steps:** Implement exact solutions provided by web app team  
**ETA After Response:** 30 minutes to implement and test

**Critical Note:** The mobile app was working with data before, but something in the recent Supabase integration changes broke the data fetching. We need the exact, working configuration and query examples to restore functionality.
