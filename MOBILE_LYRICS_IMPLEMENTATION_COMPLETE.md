## üîê Database Requirements

### **Schema Changes Needed:**
```sql
-- These columns must exist in audio_tracks table
ALTER TABLE audio_tracks 
ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS lyrics TEXT,
ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS lyrics_language VARCHAR(10) DEFAULT 'en',
ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS has_lyrics BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE;

-- Performance indexes
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_audio_tracks_lyrics 
ON audio_tracks(lyrics) WHERE lyrics IS NOT NULL;

CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_audio_tracks_has_lyrics 
ON audio_tracks(has_lyrics);
```

### **Row Level Security (RLS):**
- Lyrics inherit permissions from audio_tracks
- Public tracks: Lyrics visible to everyone
- Private tracks: Lyrics only visible to creator
- No special RLS needed for lyrics fields

## üìû Support & Questions

### **Implementation Notes:**

1. **Why only for music?**  
   Podcasts typically don't have lyrics, so we hide the fields to reduce clutter.

2. **Why recovery mechanism?**  
   Sometimes track data loads without lyrics due to caching or API issues. Recovery ensures lyrics are always available.

3. **Why not timestamped lyrics?**  
   Phase 1 focuses on basic lyrics. Timestamped/synced lyrics planned for Phase 2.

4. **Why these languages?**  
   Based on web app's target markets: UK, Nigeria, and global English speakers.

---

## üîÑ Future Enhancements (Phase 2)

### **Planned Features:**
- üîÑ **Timestamped Lyrics**: Sync with playback time
- üîÑ **Current Line Highlighting**: Auto-highlight current line
- üîÑ **Auto-Scroll**: Scroll to current line
- üîÑ **Translation Support**: Display translations side-by-side
- üîÑ **LRC Import**: Import .lrc files
- üîÑ **Lyrics Editing**: Allow creators to edit lyrics

### **Database Schema for Phase 2:**
```sql
-- New table for timestamped lyrics
CREATE TABLE track_lyrics (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
  track_id UUID REFERENCES audio_tracks(id),
  language VARCHAR(10),
  is_synced BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE
);

CREATE TABLE track_lyrics_lines (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
  lyrics_id UUID REFERENCES track_lyrics(id),
  line_number INTEGER,
  start_time DECIMAL(10,3),
  text TEXT,
  translation TEXT
);
```
