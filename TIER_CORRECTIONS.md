## Upload Limits & Storage Management

### How Upload Limits Work

**Free Tier:**
- **3 uploads total (lifetime limit)**
- Does NOT reset monthly
- Once you've uploaded 3 tracks, you must:
  - Upgrade to Pro, OR
  - Delete existing tracks to make room for new ones

**Pro Tier:**
- **10 uploads per month**
- Resets on the 1st of each month
- Previous months' uploads remain on your profile
- Subject to 500MB total storage limit

### Upload Limit Examples

**Free User Journey:**
1. Signs up, uploads 3 tracks ✅
2. Next month, tries to upload 4th track ❌
3. Options:
   - Upgrade to Pro (get 10 uploads/month)
   - Delete 1 old track, upload 1 new track
   - Keep existing 3 tracks, don't upload more

**Pro User Journey:**

**Month 1 (January):**
- Uploads 5 tracks
- Remaining uploads this month: 5
- Total tracks on profile: 5
- Storage used: 40MB / 500MB

**Month 2 (February):**
- Upload limit resets to 10 on Feb 1st ✅
- Uploads 8 new tracks
- Remaining uploads this month: 2
- Total tracks on profile: 13 (5 from Jan + 8 from Feb)
- Storage used: 104MB / 500MB

**Month 3 (March):**
- Upload limit resets to 10 on March 1st ✅
- Uploads 10 new tracks
- Remaining uploads this month: 0
- Total tracks on profile: 23 (5 + 8 + 10)
- Storage used: 184MB / 500MB

**Month 6 (June):**
- Upload limit resets to 10 on June 1st ✅
- User has 45 tracks total from previous months
- Storage used: 360MB / 500MB
- Uploads 7 new tracks
- Total tracks: 52
- Storage: 416MB / 500MB ✅ Still has room

### Storage Limit Management

**What happens when Pro user reaches 500MB storage?**

**Scenario 1: Storage full, wants to upload**
- User has 60 tracks = 480MB
- Tries to upload new 10MB track
- Total would be: 490MB ✅ Allowed (under 500MB)

**Scenario 2: Storage full, blocked**
- User has 65 tracks = 520MB
- Tries to upload new 10MB track
- System blocks upload ❌

**User sees this message:**
```
💾 Storage Limit Reached

You're using 520MB / 500MB of storage.

To upload more tracks, delete old tracks you no longer need.

[Manage My Tracks]
```

**Scenario 3: User manages storage**
- User deletes 10 old tracks (80MB freed)
- New storage: 440MB / 500MB
- Can now upload new tracks ✅

### Storage Best Practices

**For Users:**
- Keep your best work on profile
- Delete old demos/works-in-progress periodically
- Archive important tracks offline (download before deleting)
- Average user maintains 20-30 tracks = 160-240MB (plenty of room)

**What Gets Deleted:**
- When user deletes track: Removed from profile AND storage freed
- When user downgrades: Excess tracks become private (storage still counts)
- When user re-upgrades: Private tracks become public again

### Upload Limit User Messaging

**Free User Hits Limit:**
```
🎵 Upload Limit Reached

You've uploaded your 3 free tracks.

To upload more:
✨ Upgrade to Pro
• 10 uploads per month (resets monthly)
• 500MB storage
• All advanced features

£9.99/month or £99/year

[Upgrade to Pro]
```

**Pro User Hits Monthly Limit:**
```
📊 Monthly Upload Limit Reached

You've used all 10 uploads for November 2024.

Your upload limit resets on December 1, 2024.

💡 Meanwhile:
• Your existing tracks stay live
• You can still edit/manage tracks
• Storage: 280MB / 500MB available

[Manage My Tracks]
```

**Pro User Hits Storage Limit:**
```
💾 Storage Limit Reached (500MB)

You're using all 500MB of storage (62 tracks).

To upload more:
• Delete old tracks you no longer need
• Free up space for new uploads

[Manage Storage]
```

### Why This Model Works

**For Users:**
- ✅ Free tier: Try platform with 3 permanent uploads
- ✅ Pro tier: 10/month is plenty for active professionals
- ✅ Previous uploads stay forever (within storage)
- ✅ Manage storage like Spotify playlists (curate your best)

**For Business:**
- ✅ Predictable storage costs (<1% of revenue)
- ✅ Competitive with industry (SoundCloud Pro = unlimited uploads)
- ✅ No forced upgrade to expensive Enterprise tier
- ✅ Users stay on Pro long-term

**Storage Cost Analysis:**
- 500 Pro users × 10 uploads/month × 12 months = 60,000 tracks
- 60,000 tracks × 8MB = 480GB
- Supabase cost: ~£100/year
- Revenue from 500 Pro users: ~£60,000/year
- **Storage = 0.17% of revenue** ✅

### FAQ: Upload Limits

**Q: Do my uploads expire?**
A: No! All uploads stay on your profile forever (within storage limit).

**Q: If I upload 5 tracks in January, do they disappear in February?**
A: No! They stay. You just get 10 NEW upload slots in February.

**Q: What if I don't use all 10 uploads this month?**
A: Unused slots don't carry over. You get fresh 10 slots next month.

**Q: Can I upload 20 tracks if I skip a month?**
A: No. You get 10 slots per month maximum, regardless of previous months.

**Q: What happens if I downgrade from Pro to Free?**
A: You choose 3 tracks to keep public. Others become private until you upgrade again.

**Q: If I delete a track, does it free up storage?**
A: Yes! Deleting tracks frees storage for new uploads.

**Q: Can I re-upload a deleted track?**
A: Yes, if you have upload slots available and storage space.

**Q: Do I need Enterprise for unlimited uploads?**
A: No Enterprise tier for Year 1. 10/month should be plenty for 95%+ of users. If you consistently need more, contact support.

## Support & Help System (Solo Founder Model)

### Philosophy

SoundBridge's support system is designed for sustainability as a solo-founder operation. Rather than promising unrealistic response times or dedicated support staff, we focus on:

1. **Self-service first** - Comprehensive resources so users help themselves
2. **Automated guidance** - In-app help that scales without human intervention
3. **Honest expectations** - Clear response times we can actually deliver
4. **Quality over speed** - Thoughtful responses when we do reply

### Support Tiers

**Free Users:**
- Email support with 5-7 day response time
- Access to all self-service resources
- Bug reporting system

**Pro Users:**
- Email support with 3-5 day response time (faster queue)

### Feature Request System

**How It Works:**

3. Other users upvote
4. Most-requested features reviewed monthly

**Pro User Advantage:**
- Pro user requests get 2x upvote weight
- Reviewed first before Free user requests
- Direct email response if request is considered

### Community Support (Optional - Future)

**If implemented:**
- Discord server or Slack community
- Users help each other
- Founder checks in daily, answers what's unanswered
- Community does 70-80% of support
- Cost: Free
- Time investment: 15-30 min/day

**Not implemented Year 1** (too much moderation needed)

```

### Scaling Support (Future)

**When revenue supports it (Year 2+):**

**At £5,000 MRR:**
- Hire part-time community manager (10-15 hours/week)
- Response times improve to 24-48 hours
- Can launch community forum

**At £15,000 MRR:**
- Hire full-time support person
- Response times improve to 12-24 hours
- Can offer chat support during business hours

**At £50,000 MRR:**
- Hire support team (3-4 people)
- 24-hour response time guaranteed
- Live chat support
- Phone support for Pro users

**But for Year 1:** Solo founder email support is realistic and acceptable

### Support Metrics to Track

**Response Time:**
- Average time from ticket received to first response
- Target: Free 5-7 days, Pro 3-5 days

**Resolution Time:**
- Average time from ticket received to issue resolved
- Target: <14 days for 90% of tickets

**Ticket Volume:**
- How many support requests per week
- If >50/week, indicates product issues or poor documentation

**FAQ Usage:**
- How many people visit FAQ before emailing
- Target: 70%+ check FAQ first

**Self-Service Success Rate:**
- % of users who find answer in FAQ without emailing
- Target: 60%+

### Critical: What NOT to Promise

**Don't Promise:**
- ❌ 24/7 support (you need sleep)
- ❌ Phone support (too time-intensive)
- ❌ Live chat (requires constant monitoring)
- ❌ Dedicated account managers (can't scale)
- ❌ Onboarding calls (too much time per user)
- ❌ Response times under 24 hours (unrealistic solo)

**Do Promise:**
- ✅ Honest response times (3-7 days)
- ✅ Quality help when you respond
- ✅ Comprehensive self-service resources
- ✅ Bug fixes prioritized for Pro users
- ✅ Continuous improvement based on feedback

## Money-Back Guarantee & Refund Policy

### Why No Free Trial?

**SoundBridge does NOT offer a traditional 7-day free trial.** Instead, we use a superior model:

1. **Free Tier = Unlimited Trial**
   - No credit card required
   - No time limits
   - Full access to test core features (3 uploads, searches, messaging)
   - Users can evaluate platform value before committing

2. **Pro Upgrade = 7-Day Money-Back Guarantee**
   - Pay upfront (£9.99 monthly or £99 annually)
   - If not satisfied within 7 days → full refund, no questions asked
   - Account reverts to Free tier
   - Your work is protected (see below)

### Why This Approach?

**Prevents Exploitation:**
- ✅ Credit card requirement creates commitment friction
- ✅ Payment collection discourages "serial trial users"
- ✅ Refund process requires deliberate action (stops casual exploitation)
- ✅ Tracks refund patterns to identify abuse

**Better Economics:**
- ✅ Collect revenue upfront (vs. £0 during trial period)
- ✅ Refund rate typically 3-5% (95%+ users keep subscription)
- ✅ Higher conversion than traditional trials (payment = psychological commitment)

**Simpler User Experience:**
- ✅ No confusing "trial limits vs. full Pro limits"
- ✅ Clear path: Free → Upgrade → Money-back guarantee
- ✅ Aligns with industry best practices (Netflix, Spotify, Adobe all moved away from free trials)

### Refund Process

**User requests refund within 7 days of payment:**

**Step 1: Cancellation Confirmation**
```
"Are you sure you want to cancel?

You're within your 7-day money-back guarantee period.

[Keep Pro Subscription] [Process Refund & Cancel]"
```

**Step 2: Track Selection (if user has >3 uploads)**
```
"We're sorry to see you go!

Your refund of £9.99 will be processed within 3-5 business days.
Your account will revert to Free tier, which includes 3 track uploads.

You currently have 8 tracks uploaded. Which 3 would you like to keep public?

[Select 3 tracks to keep]

Note: Your other tracks will be private (not deleted). You can restore them
anytime by upgrading to Pro again."
```

**Step 3: Confirmation & Processing**
- Stripe refund processed (3-5 business days)
- User tier → 'free'
- Selected 3 tracks remain public
- Remaining tracks → `visibility: 'private'`
- Confirmation email sent
- Optional exit survey (to improve product)

### What Happens to Uploaded Tracks?

**Critical: Tracks are NEVER deleted during refund/downgrade process**

**Scenario 1: User Upgrades to Pro, Uploads 10 Tracks, Requests Refund**
- Full refund processed ✅
- User selects 3 tracks to keep public
- Remaining 7 tracks → private (hidden from public, accessible in user's dashboard)
- If user re-upgrades later → all 10 tracks automatically public again

**Scenario 2: Free User Has 3 Tracks, Upgrades to Pro, Adds 7 More, Then Downgrades**
- User selects which 3 tracks stay public (can be any of the 10)
- Other 7 → private
- No data loss, just visibility change

**Track Visibility States:**
- `public` - Visible to everyone, appears in search/profile
- `private` - Only visible to user, hidden from public
- `unlisted` - Accessible via direct link only (future feature)

### Preventing Serial Refund Abuse

**Refund Tracking System:**
- Track refund history by:
  - Email address
  - Payment method (last 4 digits)
  - IP address (for pattern detection)
  - Device fingerprint

**Abuse Prevention Rules:**

**1st Refund:**
- ✅ Processed automatically, no questions asked
- ✅ User maintains good standing

**2nd Refund (same user):**
- ⚠️ Manual review triggered
- ⚠️ Email: "We notice this is your second refund. Is there something we can help with?"
- ✅ Refund still processed, but flagged

**3rd+ Refund (same user):**
- ❌ No more money-back guarantee
- Email: "We notice you've requested multiple refunds. Unfortunately, we can no longer offer the money-back guarantee on future subscriptions. However, you can continue using our Free tier."
- User can still upgrade to Pro, but no refund option

**Multiple Account Detection:**
- If same payment method used across multiple accounts → flag as suspicious
- If same IP address with multiple refunds → flag for review
- Stripe's built-in fraud detection catches most patterns

### Edge Cases

**Edge Case 1: Annual Subscriber Requests Refund After 5 Days**
- Same 7-day money-back guarantee applies
- Full £99 refund processed
- Account reverts to Free tier
- Track selection process same as monthly

**Edge Case 2: User Requests Refund After 8 Days**
- Outside 7-day window
- No refund, but can cancel subscription
- Pro benefits continue until end of billing period
- Then account downgrades to Free tier

**Edge Case 3: Payment Fails After Initial Success**
- Grace period: 7 days to update payment method
- Email notifications: Days 1, 3, 5, 7
- After 7 days → subscription cancelled, account → Free tier
- Track selection process initiated automatically

**Edge Case 4: User Disputes Charge with Bank (Chargeback)**
- Stripe handles dispute process
- Account immediately suspended pending resolution
- If chargeback successful → account → Free tier (no track selection, system auto-selects first 3)
- If chargeback fails → account restored
- User flagged for future fraud prevention

## Removed Features (Not Viable for Year 1)

The following features were considered but removed from Year 1 scope:

- ❌ **AI Copyright Detection** - Too expensive, liability-heavy, not core value
- ❌ **AI Mastering Tools** - Requires expensive AI infrastructure
- ❌ **White-label Options** - Too complex for initial launch
- ❌ **API Access** - Not needed until developer ecosystem exists
- ❌ **Custom Integrations** - Support burden too high
- ❌ **Advanced Analytics (enterprise-level)** - Need more data first
- ❌ **Team/Agency Accounts** - Add in Year 2
- ❌ **Multi-user Permissions** - Add in Year 2

---

## Copyright Handling (All Tiers)

Instead of AI detection, SoundBridge uses:

- **User Certification:** At upload, users certify they own rights or have permission
- **DMCA Takedown Process:** Standard process for copyright claims
- **Community Reporting:** Users can report copyright violations
- **Terms of Service Enforcement:** Violations result in content removal and potential account suspension
- **Three-Strike Policy:** Repeated violations lead to permanent ban
- **Appeal Process:** Users can appeal copyright strikes with proof of ownership

**Philosophy:** Users manage their own copyright (like SoundCloud), platform responds to valid claims

---

## Technical Feasibility

### Storage Costs (Year 1 - 5,000 users)

**Assumptions:**
- 4,000 Free users × 3 tracks (lifetime) = 12,000 Free tracks
- 1,000 Pro users × average 5 uploads/month × 12 months = 60,000 Pro tracks
- **Total Storage: 72,000 tracks**

**Storage Calculation:**
- Average compressed track: 8MB (high-quality streaming)
- 72,000 tracks × 8MB = 576GB
- Supabase pricing: First 100GB free, then £0.021/GB/month
- Cost: 476GB × £0.021 = **£10/month = £120/year**

**Revenue from Pro users:**
- 1,000 Pro × £9.99/month × 12 = £119,880/year

**Storage as % of revenue:**
- £120 / £119,880 = **0.1% of revenue** ✅ Negligible

---

**With 10,000 users by end of Year 1:**
- 9,000 Free × 3 tracks = 27,000 tracks
- 1,000 Pro × 60 tracks/year = 60,000 tracks  
- Total: 87,000 tracks × 8MB = **696GB**
- Cost: 596GB × £0.021 = **£12.50/month = £150/year**
- Still only **0.13% of revenue** ✅

---

### Bandwidth Costs (Streaming)

**Assumptions:**
- Average track: 5MB (compressed for streaming)
- Each track gets 100 plays/month on average
- 72,000 tracks × 5MB × 100 plays = 36TB/month bandwidth

**Estimated Cost:** 
- With CDN caching (Cloudflare): £100-200/month
- **Annual: £1,200-2,400**
- Still only **1-2% of revenue** ✅

**Optimization Strategies:**
- Cloudflare CDN for caching popular tracks
- Progressive loading/streaming
- Quality-based streaming (adjust for connection speed)
- Cache frequently played tracks at edge

✅ **Completely manageable with CDN optimization**

---

### Year 3 Projection: 75,000 users, 10% Pro (7,500 Pro)

**Storage:**
- 67,500 Free × 3 tracks = 202,500 tracks
- 7,500 Pro × average 5 uploads/month × 12 = 450,000 tracks/year
- **Total: 652,500 tracks**

**Storage Calculation:**
- 652,500 tracks × 8MB = 5,220GB (5.2TB)
- Cost: 5,120GB × £0.021 = **£107.52/month = £1,290/year**

**Revenue:**
- 7,500 Pro × £9.99 × 12 = £899,100/year

**Storage as % of revenue:**
- £1,290 / £899,100 = **0.14% of revenue** ✅

---

### Why 10 Uploads Per Month Is Sustainable

**Most users won't max out:**
- Average Pro user: 3-5 uploads/month (not 10)
- Musicians: 1-2 singles/month + demos = 3-5 uploads
- Podcasters: 4 episodes/month = 4 uploads
- Producers: Showcase work, not archive = 5-7 uploads

**Even if everyone maxes out:**
- 1,000 Pro × 10/month × 12 = 120,000 tracks/year
- 120,000 × 8MB = 960GB
- Cost: 860GB × £0.021 = **£18/month = £216/year**
- Still only **0.18% of revenue** ✅

**Storage costs are negligible at any realistic usage level.**

---

### Comparison: Why NOT Lifetime Limit

**Old Model (10 uploads lifetime):**
- User uploads 10 tracks over 10 months
- Hits limit → frustrated → cancels subscription
- You lose: £9.99/month × remaining months
- User leaves for unlimited competitors

**New Model (10 uploads/month):**
- User uploads 5-7 tracks/month consistently
- Never hits limit
- Stays subscribed indefinitely
- You gain: £9.99/month × many years
- User happy, you profitable ✅

**The math:**
- Lifetime limit: User cancels after 10 months = £99.90 total revenue
- Monthly refresh: User stays 3 years = £359.64 total revenue
- **Monthly refresh = 3.6x more revenue per user**

## Conversion Psychology

### Free-to-Pro Conversion Path

**Scenario 1: Communication Limit**
1. User signs up, uploads 3 tracks ✅
2. Searches for collaborators (uses 2 of 5 searches) ✅
3. Finds perfect producer, sends message (1 of 3) ✅
4. Producer replies, conversation starts ✅
5. Needs to send follow-up question... **OUT OF MESSAGES** ❌
6. Sees: "Upgrade to Pro for unlimited messaging" 💰
7. **CONVERTS**

**Scenario 2: Discovery Limitation**
1. User getting good traction on platform ✅
2. Another producer wants to message them ✅
3. User wants to search producer's profile/past work... **OUT OF SEARCHES** ❌
4. Sees: "Upgrade to Pro for unlimited searches" 💰
5. **CONVERTS**

**Scenario 3: Professional Opportunity**
1. User discovered by established artist ✅
2. Artist wants to book them for session work (£300 gig) ✅
3. User can't initiate booking without Pro ❌
4. Sees: "Upgrade to Pro to accept paid bookings with payment protection" 💰
5. **CONVERTS** (£9.99 to unlock £300 opportunity = no-brainer)

**Scenario 4: Track Limit**
1. User uploaded 3 tracks, getting good engagement ✅
2. Just finished new single, wants to upload ❌
3. Must delete old track or upgrade
4. Sees: "Keep all your work online - upgrade to Pro for 10 track uploads" 💰
5. **CONVERTS**

### Why £9.99/Month Works

**Psychological Pricing:**
- Below £10 = impulse purchase threshold (doesn't require "considered expense" justification)
- Perceived as "single digit" not "double digit"
- Cheaper than Spotify Premium (£10.99) = easy mental anchor
- Annual (£99) stays below £100 psychological barrier

**Competitive Positioning:**
- LinkedIn Premium: £24.99/month (SoundBridge is 60% cheaper)
- SoundBetter Pro: $14.99/month ≈ £12 (SoundBridge is comparable/cheaper)
- Patreon creator fees: 5-12% + subscription (SoundBridge offers better value)

**Value Perception:**
- Professional tool, not consumer entertainment
- Unlocks income opportunities (bookings worth £100-1,000+)
- ROI: One booking pays for 10+ months of subscription

---

## Launch Strategy

### Early Adopter Promotion (First 3 Months)

**"Founding Member" Pricing:**
- Pro Annual: ~~£99~~ **£79/year** (20% discount)
- Pro Monthly: £9.99/month (no discount - encourage annual)
- **Lifetime rate lock:** "Your rate never increases"
- Badge: "Founding Member" on profile (social proof/status)

**Benefits:**
- ✅ Generates upfront cash flow (annual payments)
- ✅ Creates urgency ("limited time offer")
- ✅ Builds loyal early user base
- ✅ Locked-in users become advocates
- ✅ Can raise prices for new users later (grandfathered pricing creates FOMO)

**Marketing Message:**
> "Join SoundBridge as a Founding Member and lock in lifetime access to Pro for just £79/year - that's 20% off forever. Limited to first 500 members."

### Post-Launch (Month 4+)

- Return to standard £99/year pricing
- Founding Members keep £79 forever (creates urgency for new users)
- Case studies from Founding Members ("I saved £20/year for life!")

---

## Expected Conversion Rates

### Industry Benchmarks (Freemium SaaS)

- LinkedIn: ~1% free → Premium conversion
- Spotify: ~2.5% free → Premium conversion
- Professional tools: 5-15% conversion (higher for B2B/professional use cases)

### SoundBridge Projections

**Year 1 (Conservative):**
- Total users: 5,000
- Conversion rate: 10%
- Pro subscribers: 500
- Mix: 70% annual (£99) + 30% monthly (£9.99)
  - 350 annual × £99 = £34,650
  - 150 monthly × £9.99 × 12 = £17,982
- **Subscription Revenue: £52,632**

**Year 1 (Optimistic with Founding Member pricing):**
- 500 Pro subscribers at £79 (early adopter rate)
- **Subscription Revenue: £39,500**
- (Lower revenue Year 1, but higher lifetime value due to lock-in)

**Year 2:**
- Total users: 25,000
- Conversion rate: 10%
- Pro subscribers: 2,500
- **Subscription Revenue: £247,500**

**Year 3:**
- Total users: 75,000
- Conversion rate: 10%
- Pro subscribers: 7,500
- **Subscription Revenue: £742,500**

🛡️ 7-day money-back guarantee on all Pro upgrades  
🔒 Secure payment processing via Stripe  
❌ Cancel anytime - no long-term commitment  

### FAQ Section

**Do you offer a free trial?**

We don't offer a traditional free trial because our Free tier IS your trial! You get unlimited time to test SoundBridge with 3 uploads, professional searches, and messaging - no credit card required.

When you're ready to upgrade to Pro, you're protected by our 7-day money-back guarantee. If Pro isn't right for you, request a refund within 7 days for a full refund, no questions asked.

**Can I change my plan later?**

Yes! You can upgrade from Free to Pro anytime. If you start with monthly, you can switch to annual to save money. You can also cancel anytime - if you're within the first 7 days, you'll get a full refund.

**What happens when I hit my limits on Free?**

You'll see a notification letting you know you've reached your limit (searches or messages). You can wait until next month when limits reset, or upgrade to Pro anytime for unlimited access.

**Can I cancel anytime?**

Absolutely. You can cancel your Pro subscription anytime:
- **Within 7 days of payment:** Full refund, account reverts to Free tier
- **After 7 days:** No refund, but Pro benefits continue until end of billing period, then account reverts to Free tier

**What payment methods do you accept?**

We accept all major credit and debit cards (Visa, Mastercard, American Express) via Stripe. Your payment information is secure, encrypted, and never stored on our servers.

**How does the 7-day money-back guarantee work?**

If you upgrade to Pro and decide it's not for you within 7 days of payment, simply request a refund from your billing settings. You'll receive a full refund within 3-5 business days, no questions asked. Your account will revert to the Free tier.

**What happens to my content if I cancel or request a refund?**

Your content is never deleted. If you have more than 3 tracks when you downgrade to Free, you'll choose which 3 to keep public. The rest become private (only visible to you). If you upgrade to Pro again later, all your tracks automatically become public again.

**What if I uploaded 10 tracks on Pro and then cancel?**

When you cancel or request a refund, you'll select which 3 tracks to keep public (Free tier limit). Your other 7 tracks will be private - still accessible to you in your dashboard, but hidden from public view. If you re-upgrade to Pro, they'll automatically become public again. Your music is never deleted.

**Can I get a refund after 7 days?**

The money-back guarantee only applies within 7 days of payment. After 7 days, you can cancel your subscription, but won't receive a refund. Your Pro benefits will continue until the end of your current billing period.

**How do I request a refund?**

Go to Account Settings → Billing → Cancel Subscription. If you're within your 7-day window, you'll see the option to request a full refund. Click it, follow the prompts, and your refund will be processed automatically.

## Notes for Development Team

### Technical Priorities

1. **Security:** All payment processing via Stripe (PCI compliant)
2. **Scalability:** Database indexes on subscription lookups
3. **Performance:** Cache tier permissions, don't query on every request
4. **Reliability:** Webhook retry logic for failed subscription events
5. **User Experience:** Upgrade prompts at friction points, not annoying

### Edge Cases to Handle

- User upgrades mid-billing cycle → Pro-rate refund?
- User downgrades with >3 tracks → Soft delete excess tracks
- Payment fails → Grace period (7 days) before downgrade
- User disputes charge → Stripe dispute handling
- Accidental cancellation → Reactivation grace period
- Annual subscriber wants to switch to monthly → Allow with adjustment

### Database Considerations

**Track Visibility Management:**

Add these fields to tracks table:
- `visibility` - Values: 'public', 'private', 'unlisted'
- `uploaded_during_tier` - Values: 'free', 'pro'
- `file_size_mb` - Decimal value for storage tracking
- `upload_month` - Date field storing first day of upload month (for monthly limit tracking)
- `created_at` - Timestamp
- `updated_at` - Timestamp

Create indexes for performance:
- Index on user_id for quick lookups
- Index on upload_month for monthly limit checks
- Index on visibility for filtering public/private tracks

**Refund Tracking:**

Create refunds table with these fields:
- Unique ID
- User ID (reference to users table)
- Subscription ID
- Stripe refund ID
- Amount refunded
- Refund reason (text)
- Refund date (timestamp)
- Refund count (how many refunds this user has had)
- IP address
- Payment method last 4 digits
- Flagged (boolean - for abuse detection)
- Notes (text)

Create indexes:
- Index on user_id for finding user's refund history
- Index on payment_method_last4 for abuse detection
- Index on flagged for admin review

**Track Selection During Downgrade:**

Create downgrade_track_selections table:
- Unique ID
- User ID (reference to users table)
- Downgrade date (timestamp)
- From tier ('pro')
- To tier ('free')
- Selected track IDs (array of track IDs user chose to keep public)
- Auto-selected (boolean - true if system auto-selected, e.g., chargeback)
- Reason ('refund', 'cancellation', 'payment_failure', 'chargeback')

**Upload Limit Tracking:**

Create monthly_upload_tracking table:
- Unique ID
- User ID
- Month (date - first day of month)
- Upload count (integer)
- Last reset date (timestamp)

Logic for checking upload limits:
- For Free users: Count total uploads ever (lifetime limit of 3)
- For Pro users: Count uploads in current month only (limit of 10/month)
- Reset Pro users' count on 1st of each month

**Storage Limit Tracking:**

Logic for checking storage:
- Sum file_size_mb of all user's tracks
- Free users: Max 150MB
- Pro users: Max 500MB
- Block upload if adding new track would exceed limit

**Track Visibility Logic:**
- When user downgrades: Tracks beyond Free tier limit → visibility = 'private'
- When user re-upgrades: Previously private tracks → visibility = 'public'
- Tracks are NEVER deleted (unless user explicitly deletes)
- Archive old usage tracking data (searches/messages) after 12 months
- Index subscription dates for renewal queries
- Soft delete tracks (don't hard delete when downgrading)
- Track subscription history for analytics

## Financial Impact Analysis: Money-Back Guarantee vs. Free Trial

### Revenue Comparison Model

**Scenario: 5,000 Users, 10% Show Intent to Use Pro Features**

#### Traditional 7-Day Free Trial Model:
- 500 users start free trial (no payment)
- Trial conversion rate: 40-50% (industry standard)
- Actual paying users after trial: 200-250
- Revenue (assuming 225 convert): 225 × £9.99 = £2,247.75/month
- **Annual Revenue: £26,973**

**Problems with Free Trial:**
- ❌ No revenue during trial period
- ❌ Users procrastinate ("I'll try it later")
- ❌ Can exploit system (upload 10 tracks, cancel before payment)

### Why Money-Back Guarantees Convert Better

**Psychological Factors:**

**1. Loss Aversion**
- Once money leaves account, users reluctant to "lose" access
- Free trial mindset: "I haven't committed anything yet"
- Paid with guarantee mindset: "I've invested, let me get value from this"

**2. Sunk Cost Fallacy (Works in Your Favor)**
- User paid £9.99 → psychologically wants to use it
- Requesting refund requires active effort → most don't bother if getting any value
- Free trial cancellation is passive (just don't enter payment info)

**3. Selection Bias**
- Free trials attract casual browsers and tire-kickers
- Payment requirement filters for serious, committed users
- Higher intent at signup = higher retention long-term

**4. Immediacy**
- Free trial: "I'll explore this later" → never return
- Paid: "I paid for this, let me use it NOW" → immediate engagement

**Real-World Evidence:**
- **Netflix** removed free trial (2020) → subscriber growth increased
- **Spotify** requires payment method for trials → 60%+ conversion
- **Adobe** moved to paid trials → retention up 30%
- **Amazon Prime** trial requires payment → 75%+ conversion
