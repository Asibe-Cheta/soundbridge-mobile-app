# 🚨 URGENT: Mobile App Stripe Checkout Debug Request

## 📋 **Current Status:**
- ✅ **Stripe Connect (Bank Account Setup):** WORKING perfectly
- ❌ **Stripe Checkout (Upgrade Plans):** Timing out on mobile app
- 🔍 **Critical Evidence:** User received SMS verification code from Stripe (API is working!)

---

## 🎯 **IMMEDIATE ACTIONS NEEDED FROM MOBILE TEAM:**

### **1. Test Deployment Verification**
**Please test this endpoint to confirm our latest fixes are deployed:**

```
GET https://soundbridge.live/api/test-deployment
```

**Expected Response:**
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "message": "Deployment test successful",
  "timestamp": "2025-09-28T...",
  "deployment_version": "v2024-09-28-stripe-checkout-debug",
  "debug_logs_added": true,
  "cors_headers_updated": true
}
```

**❓ Question:** Do you get this response? If not, what do you see?

---

### **2. API Timeout Investigation**

**Current Issue:** Mobile app shows "Server Issue - payment server not responding" but Stripe actually processes the request (user gets SMS code).

**❓ Questions:**
1. **How long does your mobile app wait** for API responses before timing out?
2. **Can you increase the timeout** to 60 seconds for testing?
3. **What specific error details** do you see in mobile app console/logs?

---

### **3. Direct API Testing**

**Please test the Stripe Checkout API directly:**

```bash
# Test with your actual Bearer token
curl -X POST https://soundbridge.live/api/stripe/create-checkout-session \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "x-supabase-token: YOUR_ACTUAL_TOKEN_HERE" \
  -d '{"plan": "pro", "billingCycle": "monthly"}'
```

**❓ Questions:**
1. **How long does this take** to respond?
2. **What response do you get?** (Should include `sessionId` and `url`)
3. **Does the response include a Stripe checkout URL?**

---

### **4. Missing Debug Logs Investigation**

**We added comprehensive debug logging, but it's not appearing in the console. This suggests either:**
- Deployment hasn't completed
- Cache issue
- Request timing out before reaching our logs

**❓ Question:** In your mobile app console, do you see any of these debug messages?
- `🚨 STRIPE CHECKOUT DEBUG:`
- `- Plan: pro`
- `- Billing Cycle: monthly`
- `- Price ID: ...`

**If NOT, the new code isn't deployed yet.**

---

### **5. Response Handling Check**

**❓ Questions:**
1. **How does your mobile app handle** the Stripe Checkout response?
2. **Are you expecting** a specific response format?
3. **Do you automatically redirect** to the `url` field in the response?
4. **What happens if the response takes 30+ seconds?**

---

### **6. Localhost vs Production Comparison**

**You mentioned it worked on localhost but not production.**

**❓ Questions:**
1. **What's different** between localhost and production setup?
2. **Are you using different Stripe keys?** (test vs live)
3. **Are environment variables the same?**
4. **Is the timeout setting different?**

---

## 🔧 **IMMEDIATE FIXES TO TRY:**

### **Fix 1: Increase Timeout**
```javascript
// In your mobile app API call
const response = await fetch(url, {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: headers,
  body: JSON.stringify(data),
  timeout: 60000 // Increase to 60 seconds
});
```

### **Fix 2: Add Response Logging**
```javascript
// Add this to your mobile app
console.log('🔍 API Response Status:', response.status);
console.log('🔍 API Response Headers:', response.headers);
console.log('🔍 API Response Body:', await response.text());
```

### **Fix 3: Check for Partial Success**
```javascript
// Even if it times out, check if you got any response
if (response.status === 200) {
  const data = await response.json();
  if (data.url) {
    // Redirect to Stripe checkout
    window.open(data.url, '_blank');
  }
}
```

## 🎯 **SUCCESS CRITERIA:**

**When working correctly, you should see:**
1. ✅ Mobile app calls API
2. ✅ API responds with `sessionId` and `url` 
3. ✅ Mobile app redirects to Stripe checkout page
4. ✅ User enters SMS verification code on Stripe page
5. ✅ User completes payment
6. ✅ Redirects back to success page

**Currently, step 3 is failing** - mobile app isn't getting the checkout URL.

---

## 📞 **URGENT RESPONSE NEEDED:**

**Please test the above and respond with:**
1. **Deployment test results**
2. **Current timeout settings**
3. **Direct API test results** 
4. **Any debug logs you see**
5. **Specific error details from mobile app**

**The SMS code proves Stripe is working - we just need to fix the mobile app timeout/response handling!**

---

## 🚀 **Expected Timeline:**
- **Test deployment endpoint:** 2 minutes
- **Increase timeout and test:** 5 minutes  
- **Direct API testing:** 5 minutes
- **Report results:** 5 minutes

**Total: ~15 minutes to identify the exact issue**
