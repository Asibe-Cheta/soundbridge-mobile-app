## ðŸ”„ Technical Architecture

### **Data Flow:**
```
Upload Screen â†’ Database â†’ Audio Player Context â†’ Music Player Screen

formData.lyrics
  â””â”€> trackData.lyrics
      â””â”€> audio_tracks table
          â””â”€> currentTrack.lyrics
              â””â”€> Lyrics Modal
```

### **State Management:**
```typescript
// Upload Screen
const [formData, setFormData] = useState({
  lyrics: '',
  lyricsLanguage: 'en',
  // ...
});

// Audio Player Screen
const [showLyrics, setShowLyrics] = useState(false);
const [lyricsData, setLyricsData] = useState<string | null>(null);
const [isLoadingLyrics, setIsLoadingLyrics] = useState(false);
const lyricsRecoveryAttempted = useRef(false);
```

### **Recovery Mechanism:**
```typescript
const recoverLyrics = async () => {
  // Prevents multiple recovery attempts
  if (lyricsRecoveryAttempted.current) return;
  lyricsRecoveryAttempted.current = true;
  
  // Fetch from database
  const { data } = await supabase
    .from('audio_tracks')
    .select('lyrics, lyrics_language, has_lyrics')
    .eq('id', currentTrack.id)
    .single();
  
  // Update state
  if (data?.lyrics) {
    setLyricsData(data.lyrics);
    updateCurrentTrack({ lyrics: data.lyrics });
  }
};
```

## ðŸ“Š Database Schema

### **Required Columns:**
```sql
ALTER TABLE audio_tracks 
ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS lyrics TEXT,
ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS lyrics_language VARCHAR(10) DEFAULT 'en',
ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS has_lyrics BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE;
```

### **Recommended Indexes:**
```sql
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_audio_tracks_lyrics 
ON audio_tracks(lyrics) WHERE lyrics IS NOT NULL;

CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_audio_tracks_has_lyrics 
ON audio_tracks(has_lyrics);
```
